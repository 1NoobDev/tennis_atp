## ATP Tennis Rankings, Results, and Stats

For now, this contains my master ATP player file, plus historical rankings.

The player file columns are player_id, first_name, last_name, hand, birth_date, country_code.

The columns for the ranking files are ranking_date, ranking, player_id, ranking_points.

ATP rankings are mostly complete from 1983 to the end of 2014. 1982 is missing, and rankings from 1973-1981 are only intermittent.
